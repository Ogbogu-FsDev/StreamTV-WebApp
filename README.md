# TV Streaming Web Application

A web-based TV streaming platform designed to provide users with a seamless and interactive experience for streaming their favorite TV shows and movies.

## Project Overview

This TV streaming web application allows users to stream various TV shows and movies directly from a web interface. The application leverages Python (Flask), SQLite3 for database management, and JavaScript for dynamic front-end interactivity. User authentication allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their preferences for a personalized experience.

The system also records and stores activity logs (such as streaming sessions, user actions) and provides a user-friendly dashboard.
